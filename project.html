      <h2>Projects:</h2>

      <p>
        
          I don't just build projects; I go on epic quests to solve problems that may or may not exist. I've done it all. My secret weapon? The internet community and god bless LLMs.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> <b> Adaptive Spectral Alignment Networks</b> Built from scratch a deep learning architecture for time series alignment that adaptively learns spectral representations and alignment paths. The network combines spectral analysis with learned transformations to handle complex temporal patterns and phase shifts in multivariate time series data.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>PyTorch, Graph Neural Networks, Dynamic Time Warping, Spectral Analysis</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture</b> Implemented a Mixture of Experts model from scratch, including the routing mechanism, expert selection, and load balancing. The architecture efficiently scales model capacity by activating only a subset of expert networks for each input, enabling larger models with manageable computational costs.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>PyTorch, Distributed Training, CUDA, Sparse Activation</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</b> Developed GRPO from scratch, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies using group-relative comparisons. The implementation includes the core algorithm, reward shaping mechanisms, and training infrastructure for both discrete and continuous action spaces.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, Policy Gradients, CUDA</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> Multimodal Foundation Research</b> I built a vision-language model that's better at understanding financial documents than most people. It's so good, it can probably tell you what your cat is thinking. (Spoiler: it's probably plotting world domination.)
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>CLIP, Transformers, PyTorch</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> Bayesian Inference for Portfolio Risk Modeling</b> I developed a Bayesian deep learning model to predict portfolio risk. It's like having a crystal ball, but with more math and less spooky music.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Bayesian Deep Learning, Probabilistic Modeling, PyTorch</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> <b> LocalDocGPT</b> Created Local GPT for my personal use to take various kinds of documents in to produce several embeddings to answer any queries I got.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Llama3, HuggingFace, BERT, Python, MongoDB</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> LocalCodePilot</b> Created copilot for my personal use run in offline to help me to Autocomplete my codes and find my error better. <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Llama3, HuggingFace, BERT, Python, CUDA, AI Stack</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> <b> LocalTrade</b> Created LocalTrade for my personal use to trade in stock market with my own strategy with multivariate options and derivatives. <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Python, CUDA, OpenCL, DTW, LSTM, Geospatial codex</i></p>
