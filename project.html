      <h2>Projects:</h2>

      <p>
        
          I don't just build projects; I go on epic quests to solve problems that may or may not exist. From building a simple ATM to a Large Language Model, I've done it all. My secret weapon? The internet community and a whole lot of coffee.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> <b> Multimodal Foundation Research</b> I built a vision-language model that's better at understanding financial documents than most people. It's so good, it can probably tell you what your cat is thinking. (Spoiler: it's probably plotting world domination.)
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>CLIP, Transformers, PyTorch</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> Bayesian Inference for Portfolio Risk Modeling</b> I developed a Bayesian deep learning model to predict portfolio risk. It's like having a crystal ball, but with more math and less spooky music.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Bayesian Deep Learning, Probabilistic Modeling, PyTorch</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> <b> LocalDocGPT</b> Created Local GPT for my personal use to take various kinds of documents in to produce several embeddings to answer any queries I got.
            <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Llama3, HuggingFace, BERT, Python, MongoDB</i></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> <b> LocalCodePilot</b> Created copilot for my personal use run in offline to help me to Autocomplete my codes and find my error better. <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Llama3, HuggingFace, BERT, Python, CUDA, AI Stack</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> <b> LocalTrade</b> Created LocalTrade for my personal use to trade in stock market with my own strategy with multivariate options and derivatives. <br><i><b>Tech and Frameworks:</b>Python, CUDA, OpenCL, DTW, LSTM, Geospatial codex</i></p>
